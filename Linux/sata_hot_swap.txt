Naturally, you need to unmount any filesystems on the disk, and it'd be a good idea to deactivate any LVM groups (vgchange -an), and generally make sure nothing is using the disk for anything.

Once you've done that, it should be safe to unplug. If you want to be extra cautious, do echo 1 > /sys/block/(whatever)/device/delete first. That'll unregister the device from the kernel, so you know nothing's using it when you unplug it. When I do that with a drive in an eSATA enclosure, I can hear the drive's heads park themselves, so the kernel apparently tells the drive to prepare for power-down.

If you're using an AHCI controller, it should cope with devices being unplugged. If you're using some other sort of SATA controller, the driver might be confused by hotplugging.

In my experience, SATA hotplugging (with AHCI) works pretty well in Linux. I've unplugged an optical drive, plugged in a hard drive, scanned it for errors, made a filesystem and copied data to it, unmounted and unplugged it, plugged in a differerent DVD drive, and burned a disc, all with the machine up and running.
